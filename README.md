# A watsonx challenge app to generate speaker notes and audio

This app uses the [Flet](https://flet.dev/) python framework to build a native Flutter application in Python.

For best results, in a Python venv, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the `watsonx-notes` directory. You can then run the `main.py` file, or run `flet run watsonx-notes`.

If you would like to build an executable app, follow the directions [here](https://flet.dev/docs/publish).
